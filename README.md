## Concepts

- Component: Sub-Function that returns HTML
- JSX: The combination code between JS and HTML which only exists in React
- Property(=prop): the data delivered to child component from parent component

## Theories

- Why react?
  - Reactjs is used A LOT for front-end development. SUPER popular !!!
  - Unlike other front-end frameworks, Reactjs doesn't really have their OWN CUSTOM definitions.
  - So as much as you lean React, your js skill will grow up as well. COOL !!!
- React Rules
  - All react componenets should be `unique`, so you define `key` to every components you make
  - Everytime you call `setState()` react will call `render()` with new state
